    "## Question 1: Job-Hopping and Wages-Utility-Maximization (Led by Benjamin Ward)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a worker who starts every day either employed or unemployed. If you start your day employed, you work on your job for the day (one of $n$ jobs, as elaborated later) and you get to earn the wage of the job for the day. However, at the end of the day, you could lose your job with probability $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, in which case you start the next day unemployed. If at the end of the day, you do not lose your job (with probability $1-\\alpha$), then you will start the next day with the same job (and hence, the same daily wage). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you start your day unemployed, then you will be randomly offered one of $n$ jobs with daily wages $w_1, w_2, \\ldots w_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ with respective job-offer probabilities $p_1, p_2, \\ldots p_n \\in [0,1]$ (with $\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$). You can choose to either accept or decline the offered job. If you accept the job offer, your day progresses exactly like the **employed-day** described above (earning the day's job wage and possibly (with probability $\\alpha$) losing the job at the end of the day). However, if you decline the job offer, you spend the day unemployed, receive the unemployment wage $w_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ for the day, and start the next day unemployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to identify the optimal choice of accepting or rejecting any of the job offers the worker receives, in a manner that maximizes the infinite-horizon **Expected Discounted-Sum of Wages Utility**. Assume the daily discount factor for wages (employed or unemployed) is $\\gamma \\in [0,1])$. Assume Wages Utility function to be $U(w) = \\log(w)$ for any wage amount $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$.

    "## Question 2: Two-Stores Inventory Control (Led by Benjamin Ward)\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend the capacity-constrained inventory example implemented in [rl/chapter3/simple_inventory_mdp_cap.py](https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book/blob/master/rl/chapter3/simple_inventory_mdp_cap.py) as a `FiniteMarkovDecisionProcess` (the Finite MDP model for the capacity-constrained inventory example is described in detail in Chapters 1 and 2 of the RLForFinanceBook). Here we assume that we have two different stores, each with their own separate capacities $C_1$ and $C_2$, their own separate Poisson probability distributions of demand (with means $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$), their own separate holding costs $h_1$ and $h_2$, and their own separate stockout costs $p_1$ and $p_2$. At 6pm upon stores closing each evening, each store can choose to order inventory from a common supplier (as usual, ordered inventory will arrive at the store 36 hours later). We are also allowed to transfer inventory from one store to another, and any such transfer happens overnight, i.e., will arrive by 6am next morning (since the stores are fairly close to each other). Note that the orders are constrained such that following the orders on each evening, each store's inventory position (sum of on-hand inventory and on-order inventory) cannot exceed the store's capacity (this means the action space is constrained to be finite). Each order made to the supplier incurs a fixed transportation cost of $K_1$ (fixed-cost means the cost is the same no matter how many units of non-zero inventory a particular store orders). Moving any non-zero inventory between the two stores incurs a fixed transportation cost of $K_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model this as a derived class of `FiniteMarkovDecisionProcess` much like we did for `SimpleInventoryMDPCap` in the code repo. Set up instances of this derived class for different choices of the problem parameters (capacities, costs etc.), and determine the Optimal Value Function and Optimal Policy by invoking the function `value_iteration` (or `policy_iteration`) from file [rl/dynamic_programming.py](https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book/blob/master/rl/dynamic_programming.py).\n",

Assume that the customer demand for the number of Halloween masks on any day is governed by a Poisson probability distribution with mean $\\lambda_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ if you select that day’s price to be $p_i$ (where $i$ is a choice among $1, 2, \\dots, N$).\n",

    "Let's clarify some things first. Originally we have M Halloween masks. Without loss of generality, at day t, we note $m$ the amount of Halloween masks left. We want to determine $v_t(m)$ which is the maximum expected revenue from days t to T, given that we have $m$ units left at start of day t. The actions correspond to the choice of a price in $\\{p_1,...,p_n\\}$. Once we choose a price, then demand $d_t\\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)$. So the amount of masks we actually sell on that day is $\\min(d_t,m)$ (we can't sell more masks than we have). Our revenue for that day is therefore $p_i\\min(d_t,m)$, and we will have $m-\\min(d_t,m)$ masks leftover for the next day.\n",
